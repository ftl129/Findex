**Description**
This repository contains the data and source code used in the study Quantifying and Classifying Node Influence Within Arbitrarily Defined Neighborhoods.

**Data**
The file Networks.rar includes 18 networks used in this research. Most networks are sourced from an online repository (Network Repository). Details of other sources can be found in the manuscript.

**Code**
The script Findex.py calculates the proposed F-index and outputs:
F-index.
FC-index.
All orders of the F-index.
It also generates the evolution curve of node F-index with respect to the order.
